# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture
The first week of Andrew Brown's AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp was a thrilling experience, filled with valuable lessons and hands-on learning. During this week, we went over Billing and Architecture and created a diagram of the Crudder app that we are going to create.

# Gather Requirements
We started by learning about the importance of gathering requirements before starting any project. This involves understanding the user's needs, business objectives, and the constraints of the project. It helps in creating a solid foundation for the project and ensures that the end product meets the user's expectations.

# Conceptual Design (Napkin)
Next, we learned about the conceptual design phase, where we use simple sketches or diagrams to visualize the high-level structure of the project. This phase is also referred to as the "napkin phase" as the designs are usually created on a napkin or a piece of paper.

# Logical Design (Blue Print)
We then learned about the logical design phase, where we create a more detailed blueprint of the project. This includes adding more detail to the conceptual design and determining the necessary components and their relationships.

# Physical Design (Resource names)
The physical design phase involves determining the resource names and the relationships between the resources. This phase helps in creating a clear and concise picture of the architecture and helps in identifying any potential issues.

# Ask Dumb Questions (Risks, Assumptions, Constraints)
During the bootcamp, we also learned about the importance of asking dumb questions. This involves asking questions about the risks, assumptions, and constraints of the project to ensure that nothing is overlooked.

# Play be the packet (User Experience)
We learned about the importance of playing by the packet and considering the user experience. This involves understanding the user's needs and ensuring that the architecture and design meet those needs.

# Document Everything
Documentation is a critical aspect of any project, and we learned about the importance of documenting everything. This includes documenting the requirements, design, and implementation details.

# TOGAF standard for architecture
We also learned about the TOGAF standard for architecture, which is a framework for enterprise architecture that provides a common language and methodology for designing and managing enterprise architecture.

# AWS Well-Architected Framework
Finally, we learned about the AWS Well-Architected Framework, which is a set of best practices for reviewing workloads against current best practices in the cloud.

# Homework 
For the homework, we were asked to draw a conceptual design on a napkin or create a diagram and turn it in. This will give us an opportunity to put into practice what we learned during the first week of the bootcamp.

In conclusion, the first week of the AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp was a fantastic experience. We learned about the billing and architecture aspects of AWS and various other critical elements of project design and implementation. I am looking forward to the upcoming weeks, where we will dive deeper into the technical aspects of AWS and build our app.
